Hi, I'm Deepanshu Kumar


I’m an undergraduate student passionate about creating fast, reliable, and well-structured web applications using the MERN stack.
Currently, I’m working on a project called Inventory-Trackor while exploring advanced concepts in Node.js and backend system design.

I’m particularly interested in how authentication, automation, and performance optimization come together to make apps scalable and efficient. I aim to write clean, maintainable code that’s easy to understand and performs well in real-world use cases.

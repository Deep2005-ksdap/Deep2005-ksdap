# Hi, I'm Deepanshu Kumar

I’m an undergraduate student passionate about creating fast, reliable, and well-structured web applications using the MERN stack.  
Currently, I’m working on a project called **LinkX** while exploring advanced concepts in Node.js and backend system design.

I am particularly focused on **authentication, backend efficiency, and system optimization** to build scalable and reliable web applications. I strive to write clean, maintainable code that performs effectively in real-world scenarios.
